### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) FOR REFUGEE AND ASSYLUM SEEKERS IN CANADA

Objectives: The objective of this project is to gain insights into the global refugee and asylum seeker trends from 2012 into Canada. The The analysis will uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within this data.

Data Analysis Tool: Python


#### Observations
The dataset covers refugee and asylum seeker data in Canada from 2012 to 2022.
UNHCR Refugees:The average number of UNHCR refugees per country per year is approximately 752.The data shows significant variability, with some countries contributing a very small number of refugees and others contributing very large numbers (up to 75,098).
Asylum Seekers:The average number of asylum seekers per country per year is around 323.There is considerable variability in the number of asylum seekers, with some countries having none and others having up to 19,765.
Total Count:The combined total (UNHCR refugees and asylum seekers) per country per year averages around 1,076.This total also shows high variability, with maximum values reaching up to 75,294.
Data Consistency:The dataset has no missing values for any of the columns.


#### Correlation Observation
Year has very weak correlations with all the other variables, suggesting that changes in year do not strongly predict changes in the number of UNHCR refugees, asylum seekers, or the total count.
UNHCR-refugees and total-count are very strongly correlated, indicating that the number of UNHCR refugees is a major component of the total count.
Asylum-seekers have a moderate correlation with the total-count, reflecting their contribution to the total count but to a lesser extent than UNHCR refugees.
UNHCR-refugees and asylum-seekers are weakly correlated, suggesting that countries with higher numbers of refugees do not necessarily have correspondingly high numbers of asylum seekers, and vice versa.

#### INSIGHTS
Increasing Trends: Both the number of UNHCR refugees and asylum seekers in Canada have steadily increased from 2012 to 2022.
Higher Refugee Numbers: The number of UNHCR refugees has consistently been higher than the number of asylum seekers each year.
Parallel Growth: The similar growth patterns suggest that factors affecting one group also impact the other.
